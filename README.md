## 📚 Learning Goals

This project provided valuable insights into creating complex, animated environments in Blender, specifically focusing on:

1. **Lighting and Atmosphere**: Understanding how to create realistic lighting with neon effects and reflective surfaces typical of the cyberpunk genre.
2. **Modeling Architecture**: Developing buildings, streets, and urban elements to create an immersive cityscape.
3. **Animation**: Crafting a smooth, aerial camera animation to showcase the CyberCity with animated bill boards and roads.
